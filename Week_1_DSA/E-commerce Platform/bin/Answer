//Asymptotic Notation
/*
 1)
 Big O Notation: It is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of input. 
 Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario and can be used to describe the execution 
 time required or the space used by an algorithm.

/*2)
Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operations.
Average Case: The expected number of operations an algorithm performs, averaged over all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations.*/
