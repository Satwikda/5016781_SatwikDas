//Asymptotic Notation
/*
 1)
 Big O Notation: It is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of input. 
 Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario and can be used to describe the execution 
 time required or the space used by an algorithm.
 */

/*2)
Best Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the minimum number of operations.
Average Case: The expected number of operations an algorithm performs, averaged over all possible inputs.
Worst Case: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations.*/


//STEP2:-ANALYSIS
//Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms
Linear search: The time complexity is O(n) in the worst case.
Binary search: The time complexity is O(log n) in the worst case, but this requires the array to be sorted.

//Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why
Linear search: More suitable for small datasets or when the array is not sorted, as it does not require preprocessing.
Binary search: More suitable for large datasets where the array can be sorted beforehand, providing much faster search times.
